## About !!!

This repository contains my PATH, my JOURNEY in learning C++ from scratch. 
Each numbered script represents a step in my learning process.

## Learning Approach !!!

No AI, no google searches with copy copy paste, no teacher or tutorials, 
the only source: *Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++* by Bjarne Stroustrup.
